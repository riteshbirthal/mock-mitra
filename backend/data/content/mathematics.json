        "content": "# Percentage - Complete Guide\n\n## Basic Concept\nPercentage means \"per hundred\". It is denoted by the symbol %.\n\n**Formula:** Percentage = (Value / Total Value) × 100\n\n## Important Formulas\n\n### 1. Finding Percentage\n- X% of Y = (X × Y) / 100\n- Example: 15% of 200 = (15 × 200) / 100 = 30\n\n### 2. Converting Fractions to Percentage\n- Fraction × 100 = Percentage\n- Example: 3/4 = (3/4) × 100 = 75%\n\n### 3. Percentage Increase\n- Increase% = (Increase / Original) × 100\n- New Value = Original × (1 + Increase%/100)\n\n### 4. Percentage Decrease\n- Decrease% = (Decrease / Original) × 100\n- New Value = Original × (1 - Decrease%/100)\n\n### 5. Successive Percentage Change\nIf two successive changes are a% and b%, then:\n- Net change = a + b + (ab/100)%\n\n## Quick Conversion Table\n| Fraction | Percentage |\n|----------|------------|\n| 1/2 | 50% |\n| 1/3 | 33.33% |\n| 1/4 | 25% |\n| 1/5 | 20% |\n| 1/6 | 16.67% |\n| 1/8 | 12.5% |\n| 1/10 | 10% |\n| 2/3 | 66.67% |\n| 3/4 | 75% |\n| 4/5 | 80% |\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Q1:** Find 25% of 480\n- Solution: (25 × 480) / 100 = 120\n\n**Q2:** What percent is 45 of 180?\n- Solution: (45/180) × 100 = 25%\n\n**Q3:** A price increases from ₹200 to ₹250. Find the percentage increase.\n- Solution: Increase = 50, Increase% = (50/200) × 100 = 25%\n\n**Q4:** If a number is increased by 20% and then decreased by 20%, find the net change.\n- Solution: Net = 20 + (-20) + (20 × -20)/100 = -4%\n\n## Tips for Quick Calculation\n- 10% → Divide by 10\n- 5% → Half of 10%\n- 1% → Divide by 100\n- 25% → Divide by 4\n- 50% → Divide by 2",

        "content": "# Ratio and Proportion\n\n## Ratio\nA ratio compares two quantities of the same kind.\n\n### Format\n- Written as a:b or a/b\n- Read as \"a is to b\"\n\n### Properties\n1. a:b = ma:mb (multiply both by same number)\n2. a:b = a/k : b/k (divide both by same number)\n3. If a:b = c:d, then ad = bc (cross multiplication)\n\n## Proportion\nWhen two ratios are equal, they are said to be in proportion.\n\n### Format\na:b :: c:d (a is to b as c is to d)\n\n### Types\n1. **Direct Proportion**: When one increases, other also increases\n2. **Inverse Proportion**: When one increases, other decreases\n\n## Important Formulas\n\n### 1. Finding Fourth Proportional\nIf a:b = c:x, then x = (b×c)/a\n\n### 2. Finding Mean Proportional\nMean proportional of a and b = √(ab)\n\n### 3. Finding Third Proportional\nIf a:b = b:x, then x = b²/a\n\n### 4. Compound Ratio\n(a:b) × (c:d) = ac:bd\n\n### 5. Duplicate Ratio\nDuplicate ratio of a:b = a²:b²\n\n### 6. Sub-duplicate Ratio\nSub-duplicate ratio of a:b = √a:√b\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Q1:** If A:B = 2:3 and B:C = 4:5, find A:B:C\n- A:B = 2:3 = 8:12\n- B:C = 4:5 = 12:15\n- A:B:C = 8:12:15\n\n**Q2:** Divide ₹1200 in the ratio 3:5\n- Total parts = 8\n- First share = (3/8) × 1200 = ₹450\n- Second share = (5/8) × 1200 = ₹750\n\n**Q3:** If 15:x :: x:60, find x\n- x² = 15 × 60 = 900\n- x = 30\n\n## Application Areas\n- Partnership problems\n- Mixture problems\n- Speed, Time, Distance\n- Work problems",

Profit/Loss Calculation\n- Profit = SP - CP\n- Loss = CP - SP\n- Profit% = (Profit/CP) × 100\n- Loss% = (Loss/CP) × 100\n\n### 2. Finding SP from Profit%\n- SP = CP × (100 + Profit%)/100\n- SP = CP × (100 - Loss%)/100\n\n### 3. Finding CP from Profit%\n- CP = SP × 100/(100 + Profit%)\n- CP = SP × 100/(100 - Loss%)\n\n### 4. Discount\n- Discount = MP - SP\n- Discount% = (Discount/MP) × 100\n- SP = MP × (100 - Discount%)/100\n\n### 5. Successive Discounts\nIf discounts are x% and y%, then:\n- Single equivalent discount = x + y - (xy/100)%\n\n## Special Cases\n\n### When CP of x items = SP of y items\nProfit% = [(x-y)/y] × 100\n\n### False Weight Profit\nProfit% = [(True Weight - False Weight)/False Weight] × 100\n\n## Practice Problems\n\n**Q1:** CP = ₹400, SP = ₹480. Find Profit%\n- Profit = 80, Profit% = (80/400) × 100 = 20%\n\n**Q2:** MP = ₹500, Discount = 20%. Find SP\n- SP = 500 × (100-20)/100 = ₹400\n\n**Q3:** Article sold at 10% profit. If bought for ₹20 less and sold for ₹10 more, profit would be 40%. Find CP.\n- Let CP = x\n- 1.1x = Original SP\n- (x-20) × 1.4 = 1.1x + 10\n- Solving: x = ₹200\n\n## Tips\n- Always calculate on CP for profit/loss\n- Discount is always on MP\n- Read questions carefully for what price is given",

Combined Work\nIf A does work in 'a' days and B in 'b' days:\n- Together in = ab/(a+b) days\n\n### 2. Work and Wages\n- Wages ∝ Work done\n- Wages ∝ Efficiency\n\n### 3. Men-Days Work\n- M₁ × D₁ × H₁ / W₁ = M₂ × D₂ × H₂ / W₂\n- Where M = Men, D = Days, H = Hours, W = Work\n\n### 4.

Together how many days?\n- Together = (10×15)/(10+15) = 150/25 = 6 days\n\n**Q2:** A is thrice as efficient as B. If A takes 12 days less than B, find time taken by each.\n- Let B's time = 3x, A's time = x\n- 3x - x = 12, x = 6\n- A = 6 days, B = 18 days\n\n**Q3:** 12 men complete work in 18 days. How many men needed to complete in 12 days?\n- M₁D₁ = M₂D₂\n- 12 × 18 = M₂ × 12\n- M₂ = 18 men\n\n**Q4:** Pipe A fills tank in 6 hours, B empties in 8 hours. If both open, when will tank be full?\n- Net filling rate = 1/6 - 1/8 = 1/24\n- Time = 24 hours\n\n## Tips\n- Use LCM method for easier calculation\n- Convert efficiency to daily work done\n- In negative work, subtract the rates",
